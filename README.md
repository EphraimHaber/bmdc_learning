# BMDC Learning
---
## Welcome!
Welcome to the `BMDC Learning` Repo! 
We created this repo so all students/graduates of BMDC can contribute and share knowledge, so all future (and current) generations of BMDC can have a good source of material to learn from and exercise.

## How to use:
In the repo, we have 3 main folders:
- Learning
- Exercises
- Courses

Each folder has a purpose:
### Learning
This folder is for material for learning subjects/topics. 
It contains either references to material on the internet that were reccomended, or material that BMDC students wrote and contributed.

### Exercises
This folder if for exercises, also split up by subject/topics. 
It contains either references to exercises on the internet that were reccomended, or material that BMDC students wrote and contributed

### Courses
This is the interesting folder.
Say you want to learn a new topic. 
To properly learn the topic, you will need a good blend of learning material and exercises. 
This is the place, where you can find/contribute a recommended blend of material and exercises from the `Learning` and `Exersices` folder, and also external sources if needed.

## Contributing
Contributing is simple!
If you'd like to contribute anything, switch to a a new branch, and either create a folder for the topic if it doesn't exist, or add it under a folder for the topic if it exists already, and make a PR!
The reccomended format for material and courses is an `.md` file, which may point to external sources if needed. 
If you're contributing an exercise that has a few files, just create a folder for your exercise, with all the files.
We also recommend adding the authors name to each `.md` file (Checkout `Learning_Material/Networking/OSI_Model.md` for an example)

## Summary
We hope this will be a good source for years to come for BMDC students to gain and share knowledge. 
Enjoy, and good luck!!!
